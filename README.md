# File-Intergrity-Monitor
Here, I have created a file integrity moniting system in which it detects whether a original file is changed or not.

* Create a custom/proof of concept File Integrity Monitor(FIM)
       #Created a INtegrity baseline of target files/folders using the SHA-512 hashing algorithm
       #Continously made comparison of actual files vs baseline, raised alerts if any deviations occurred
       #Sent alert x-alert vis y-means to allow further investigation of potential compromise
